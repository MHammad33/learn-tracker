# 📚 LearnTracker – Your Personal Learning Streak Tracker

LearnTracker is a focused, minimal web app to help you **track what you learn daily**, build consistency, and reflect on your growth — one day, one insight at a time.

## ❓ Why This Project?

In the age of infinite content, most learners face this:

- Consuming too much but forgetting fast
- Starting strong, but struggling to stay consistent
- No clear proof or record of what they've actually learned

**LearnTracker solves this** by giving you a quiet, focused space to:

- Log your daily learning in your own words
- Build a visual streak to stay consistent
- Reflect and revisit past learnings
