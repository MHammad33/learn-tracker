# ðŸŒŸ Vision â€“ LearnTracker

In a world flooded with tutorials and content, learners are overwhelmed. We start strong, but fall off track, and lose motivation when we can't see our progress.

**LearnTracker exists to fix that.**

Itâ€™s a lightweight tool to help learners:

- Reflect on what they learn every day
- Build a visual streak of consistency
- Make learning a habit, not a phase

No fluff. No pressure. Just one log a day.

This app is for anyone who believes that growth compounds â€” but needs a nudge to stay on track.

**Our vision:**  
Make lifelong learning **visible, trackable, and joyful** for every self-taught learner in the world.
